When the copper does a write to the BPL1DAT register the border opens after the copper write/Move that takes 8 lores pixel.
Sprites are now visible and palette switching is also possible without any bitplanes being displayed.

When bitplane data should be manually displayed, the copper write to BPL1DAT should be finished. That means a copper wait horizontal position of HSTART(-8*n) whereas n is the number of bitplanes that ranges from 1..7.
There must be a special order when initializing the BPLxDAT registers for the other bitplanes. It is important that BPL1DAT is always written last as it starts the parallel to serial shift and the of all BPLxDAT registers output.
A typical coppercommands sequence for every line that belongs to the display for a 7 bitplanes display could look like this:

CWAIT HSTART-(8*7),y
CMOVE #data,BPL7DAT
CMOVE #data,BPL6DAT
CMOVE #data,BPL5DAT
CMOVE #data,BPL4DAT
CMOVE #data,BPL3DAT
CMOVE #data,BPL2DAT
CMOVE #data,BPL1DAT
