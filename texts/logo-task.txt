Let's start with the logo. It's someting special. One of the bars and the logo share the same palette. So we got a restriction here.

The palette of the logo should have a colour gradient from a dark colour to a bright colour that range from color00 - color15.
Thus we also have a colour gradient for one bar. It doesn't have to be blue, but it can be. Whatever your colour gradient looks like I will adapt the other bars colour gradients.

The logo should have the dimensions 256x54 pixel in 16 colours.
Colour 00 and colour 08 are always transparent and cant be used.

You can only use the lower 8 colours (colour 01-07) OR the upper 8 colours (colour 09-15) for the logo.
A a consequence the logo will be dark with the lower 8 colours or bright with upper 8 colours.
